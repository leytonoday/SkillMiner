# 2. CQRS

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the system grows in complexity and size, there's potential for there to be challenges when managing both the read and write operations.

There should be two types of requests: Queries (for read operations) and Commands (for write operations).

Queries should only read and have no side-effects, whereas commands should have side effects.

For further context, see this article by Martin Fowler: <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html>

## Decision

The CQRS pattern has been applied. However, there is only one database. Read and write operations (queries and commands) do not interact with separate databases.

## Consequences

- Read and write operations are completely segregated.
- Simplified maintenance. With a clearer separation of concerns, the codebase is easier to maintain and extend.
- Read and write modals for a business entity are split into two separate models.
