# 7. Repository Pattern

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In developing SkillMiner, managing interactions with the database is a critical concern. We aim to abstract away database complexities while ensuring our system remains testable and maintainable.

## Decision

We will implement the Repository pattern for our data access. This pattern provides a layer of abstraction over the database, allowing us to interact with some DB without coupling the business logic to any particular storage mechanism.

## Consequences

- **Abstraction** - The Repository pattern abstracts away database details, allowing developers to work with domain-specific objects rather than SQL queries.

- **Testability** - By decoupling the business logic from the database access code, the Repository pattern makes it easier to write unit tests for the application. Mock repositories can be used during testing to simulate database behavior without actually interacting with the database.

- **Encapsulation** - Repositories encapsulate the logic for querying and manipulating data, promoting a clean separation of concerns within the codebase.

- **Flexibility** - Since the Repository pattern defines a clear interface for data access, it enables us to easily switch between different data storage solutions without affecting the rest of the application.

- **Overhead** - Introducing an additional layer of abstraction may lead to some overhead, particularly in simple CRUD operations.
